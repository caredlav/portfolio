        <h2>Full name: Carlos Eduardo Lavado Olivero</h2>
        <h2>Profession: Computer Engineer / Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
        <p>Hi, as I said before, my name is Carlos Lavado. I'm from Venezuela but currently living
            in Colombia. I studied Computer Engineering in college and then extended to the world of Full
            Stack Development. The reason why I left my country was to get better opportunities for me and 
            my family, due to the social-economic situation that has been trough in Venezuela. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I always glad to meet new people, although at the beginning I can be a litle shy and quite but 
            once I get to know a person, I become more outgoing and more friendly.
            <br>
            <br>
            My hobbies are:

            I'm so into these hoobies since I can remember... Knowing about videogames was one
            of the reasons I wanted to become a programmer, though.
